# Preprocessing the ICBe Dataset

_This is my best attempt at connecting the [documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aJkweohbfIWtNpJw1CmXbeIiK6czbJ5iPyKwiYP1YlU/edit#heading=h.61nwccqse1xi) to the column names in `ICBe_V1.1_events_agreed.Rds`. See below for identified problems._

Each crisis is split into sentences. Each sentence can contain multiple events. The event attributes are then as follows (or see the much nicer [html mindmap](./event.html)):

- **EVENT**
    - [do_duration]
    - [...bunch of other stuff, like crisno and date...]
    - [event_type]
        - action
            - [do_actor_a]
            - [do_actor_b]
            - *implicit:* only one actor? (vs an interaction)
                - action
                    - *implicit:* armed?
                        - armed
                            - *implicit:* escalatory?
                                - escalatory
                                    - [act_escalate]
                                        - *contains the event label*
                                - deescalatory
                                    - [act_deescalate]

In practice, there are a few caveats. Also see the R code.

- there are additional fields
    - `do_kind` and `condition_do_kind` seem to contain info about act/interact, armed/unarmed, escalatory/deescalatory (i.e. three levels in the tree)
        - needs verification of consistency
    - `interact_kind` and `condition_interact_kind` seem to contain info on armed/unarmed, escalatory/deescalatory
        - needs verification of consistency
- the existence (i.e. non-NA, non-empty) of children doesn't imply the existence of parents
    - in other words, some children don't have parents
    - e.g. some interact_escalates don't have an event_type of action
- actors aren't always specified
