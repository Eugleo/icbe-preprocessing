# Preprocessing the ICBe Dataset

_This is my best attempt at connecting the [documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aJkweohbfIWtNpJw1CmXbeIiK6czbJ5iPyKwiYP1YlU/edit#heading=h.61nwccqse1xi) to the column names in `ICBe_V1.1_events_agreed.Rds`. See below for identified problems._

Each crisis is split into sentences. Each sentence can contain multiple events. Each of the events can have the following attributes (or see the much nicer [html mindmap](./event.html)). 


- [do_duration]
- [...bunch of other stuff, like crisno and date...]
- [event_type], **NOT mutually exclusive!**
    - action
        - [do_actor_a]
        - [do_actor_b]
        - *implicit:* only one actor? (vs an interaction)
            - action

# Questions
- What is the difference between do_kind and do_interact_kind?
    - Maybe whether to choose one or the other is inferred from the (non)existence of do_actor_b?

# Caveats

- The coders were able to "nest" the tags, however, the structure of the hierarchy isn't preserved
    - I.e. the coder could say `X was thinking about (Y doing D to Z)`
    - The structure can be partially recovered, the "main" action ("think" in the example above) seems to be the one saved in event_type
    - It is unlcear how deep the nesting could go, and in which ways the different tags could be combined
