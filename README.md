# Preprocessing the ICBe Dataset

_This is my best attempt at connecting the [documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aJkweohbfIWtNpJw1CmXbeIiK6czbJ5iPyKwiYP1YlU/edit#heading=h.61nwccqse1xi) to the column names in `ICBe_V1.1_events_agreed.Rds`. See below for identified problems._

Each crisis is split into sentences. Each sentence can contain multiple events. Each of the events can have the following attributes (or see the much nicer [html mindmap](./event.html)). 


- [do_duration]
- [...bunch of other stuff, like crisno and date...]
- [event_type], **NOT mutually exclusive!**
    - action
        - [do_actor_a]
        - [do_actor_b]
        - *implicit:* only one actor? (vs an interaction)
            - action

# Questions
- What is the difference between do_kind and do_interact_kind?
    - It is not an action/interaction split

# Caveats

- The coders could input values for labels such as do_actor and interact_increasecoop even though they didn't label the event as action
    - ...and they did this, often
- the existence (i.e. non-NA, non-empty) of children doesn't imply the existence of parents
    - in other words, some children don't have parents
    - e.g. some interact_escalates don't have an event_type of action
- actors aren't always specified
- experts were allowed to label one event with multiple event types (ie. both action AND thought)
